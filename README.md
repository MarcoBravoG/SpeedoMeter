## Prerequisites 
Needs Android 5.0+ to run and Enabled Location and Network Services .


## Description
A speedometer app developed by me [@codedsun](https://github.com/codedsun)
The idea behind this app is to let drive the drivers on busy and rushy roads hassle free by this app.
This speedometer app uses ** Google FusedLocation Api **  and renders the distance ,average speed and top speed of your trip.

## Features 
This app inputs speed (throttle ) by the user which is also between the limit of ((100-180)) . If the driver goes beyond the throttle speed ,the speedometer starts blocking the calls which are received by the user ,hence the driver will not be disturbed by the calls and hence will reduce the chances of using phones at high speed driving .



## Implementation 

1. Google Fused Location API
2. Telephony Manager
3. Open source library for gauge view (thanks !)
